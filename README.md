Glamlex - Appointment Manager Web App

Overview:
My best friend is an amazing cosmetologist! She has been wanting to start her own business for some time. I want her to succeed! This app will allow a user to create an account where they will be able to input, view, and edit their appointments as well as delete them once held. 
(I plan to expand capability and design, then make it go live so that she can use it as her business grows.)

Prerequisites:

To try it run the following commands:

$ bundle install 

$ shotgun
